Collaborative Open Plant Omics (COPO) is a website portal where scientists describe their research objects (raw or
processed data, reads, samples, images etc.) using community-sanctioned metadata sets and vocabularies [#f1]_.

As a metadata broker, COPO encourages data generators to adhere to
:abbr:`FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable)` [#f2]_ when submitting research objects, using semantic
terms to add meaning to them and specify relationships between them.

COPO uses public or institutional repositories like
`European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home>`__ and
`National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov>`__ to share the
research objects to the wider scientific community.

COPO is developed by a team of Research Software Engineers at the `Earlham Institute <https://www.earlham.ac.uk/>`_.
Contributions are welcomed in the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/collaborative-open-plant-omics/COPO>`__.

Visit the `COPO website <https://copo-project.org/>`__  to make manifest submissions. An ORCID ID is required to
access the application.

.. hint::

   You can register for an ORCID ID on the `ORCID website <https://orcid.org/signin/>`__ for free.
