Getting Started

Collaborative OPen Omics (COPO) is a website portal where scientists describe their research objects (raw or
processed data, reads, samples, images etc.) using community-sanctioned metadata sets and vocabularies [#f1]_.

As a metadata broker, COPO encourages data generators to adhere to
:abbr:`FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable)` [#f2]_ principles when submitting research objects,
using semantic terms to add meaning to them and specify relationships between them.

COPO uses public or institutional repositories like
`European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home>`__ and
`National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov>`__ to share the
research objects to the wider scientific community.

COPO is developed by a team of Research Software Engineers at the `Earlham Institute <https://www.earlham.ac.uk/>`__.
Contributions are welcomed in the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/collaborative-open-plant-omics/COPO-production>`__.
All contributors must abide by the code of conduct described in the :ref:`code-of-conduct` section.

Visit the `COPO website <https://copo-project.org>`__  to make manifest submissions. An ORCID ID is required to
access the application.

The website requires cookies, fonts and the limited processing of your personal data in order to function well. By using
the portal you are consenting to this. To find out more about how COPO uses cookies and your personal data, please see
our :ref:`privacy-notice` and :ref:`terms-of-use`.

Accessing COPO Website
------------------------

There are two ways to access the COPO website: **Demo** mode and **Production** mode.

Navigate to `COPO live website <https://copo-project.org/copo>`__ to access the production mode **or** navigate to the
`COPO demo website <https://demo.copo-project.org/copo>`__ to access the demonstration mode.

.. note::

   * **Production mode** is the live version of the COPO application. It is recommended to submit real data to the
     production mode because the submissions are made to the final repository.

   * **Demo mode** is a testing environment for the COPO application. It is not recommended to submit real data to the
     demo mode because any submissions done are considered test submissions and there will be no submissions to
     the final repository.
