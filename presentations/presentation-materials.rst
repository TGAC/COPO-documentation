#. **Advancing Biodiversity Research: The Evolution of Collaborative OPen Omics (COPO) Project**

   - Presented at the Earlham Institute internal seminar

   - **Date**: Tuesday 23rd April, 2024

   - **Presenter**: Miss Aaliyah Providence, Junior Software Developer of the COPO team

   - **Abstract**:
      This seminar explores the evolution of the Collaborative OPen Omics (COPO) project as an
      open-source metadata broker in biodiversity research. With its capability to broker
      different data seamlessly, COPO has revolutionised the way by which researchers collaborate
      and share information.

      An integral part of COPO's development involves standardising as well as enriching metadata
      and enabling the integration of diverse datasets for publication to the European Nucleotide
      Archive (ENA) which facilitates public dissemination.

      Additionally, COPO's user-friendly Application Programming Interface (API) empowers users
      to query sample data efficiently, further enhancing accessibility and interoperability in
      biodiversity studies. Through its continuous evolution, COPO continues to drive innovation
      and collaboration in the field of bioscience research.

#. **Collaborative OPen Omics (COPO) - Building, Testing and Deployment**

   - **Authors**: COPO team - Aaliyah Providence, Debby Ku and Felix Shaw

   - **Abstract**:
      Collaborative OPen Omics (COPO) is a user-friendly platform that allows scientists to easily upload, update, and
      publish metadata while adhering to community standards, promoting transparent data sharing. Built with
      cutting-edge technology, it utilises Docker Swarm for seamless service management, ensuring continuous
      availability, scalability, and ease of maintenance.

      Security is prioritised in COPO's architecture, with distinct network layers preventing direct client access
      to back-end data repositories. Docker secrets are employed to enforce strict measures against unauthorised
      access, enhancing data protection and platform integrity.

      Overall, COPO provides a sophisticated solution for scientific data management, integrating modern methodologies
      and security protocols to facilitate collaborative research efforts and promote scientific advancement.
