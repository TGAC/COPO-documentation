#. **Advancing Biodiversity Research: The Evolution of Collaborative OPen Omics (COPO) Project**

   - Presented at the Earlham Institute internal seminar

   - **Date**: Tuesday 23rd April, 2024

   - **Presenter**: Miss Aaliyah Providence, Junior Software Developer of the COPO team

   - **Abstract**:
      This seminar explores the evolution of the Collaborative OPen Omics (COPO) project as an
      open-source metadata broker in biodiversity research. With its capability to broker
      different data seamlessly, COPO has revolutionised the way by which researchers collaborate
      and share information.

      An integral part of COPO's development involves standardising as well as enriching metadata
      and enabling the integration of diverse datasets for publication to the European Nucleotide
      Archive (ENA) which facilitates public dissemination.

      Additionally, COPO's user-friendly Application Programming Interface (API) empowers users
      to query sample data efficiently, further enhancing accessibility and interoperability in
      biodiversity studies. Through its continuous evolution, COPO continues to drive innovation
      and collaboration in the field of bioscience research.
