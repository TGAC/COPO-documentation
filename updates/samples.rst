Updating Samples
==============================

Samples can be updated by re-uploading/re-submitting the manifest that was used to create them with the amended changes
**before** the samples have been updated or rejected by a sample manager and submitted to
:abbr:`ENA (European Nucleotide Archive)` [#f1]_.

Please be aware that not all field values of existing samples can be updated. The fields that can be
updated are listed below.


.. note::

   * The manifest must be re-uploaded with the amendments included for the change or update to occur.

   * You **cannot** re-upload a manifest with some of the existing samples removed and expect the samples to be removed
     from the sample record. If you would like to remove or delete existing samples from the manifest record, please
     contact :email:`COPO team <ei.copo@earlham.ac.uk>` for assistance detailing the profile title and reason for the
     removal.

   * Fields are also referred to as columns in the manifest.

   * If you would like to update a field that is not listed below, please contact :email:`COPO team <ei.copo@earlham.ac.uk>`

   * If you would like to update a field value of a sample that has already been accepted by a sample manager
     and submitted to ENA, please contact :email:`COPO team <ei.copo@earlham.ac.uk>`. Please note that the field value
     will be updated in both COPO records and ENA records.
