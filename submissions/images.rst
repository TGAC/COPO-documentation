How to Submit Images
=====================

.. note::

   * Images can only be submitted after samples have been uploaded in the **Upload Spreadsheet** dialogue.

   * Images can only be submitted via a ToL [#f1]_ profile. Please see: :ref:`Steps to Create a Tree of Life Profile <tol-profile-walkthrough>`
     for guidance.

   * The filename of sample images must be named as ``{Specimen_ID}-{n}.[jpg|png]`` where ``{n}`` is the image number,
     ``{Specimen_ID}`` is the specimen ID of the sample in the manifest and ``jpg`` or ``png`` is the extension of the file.
