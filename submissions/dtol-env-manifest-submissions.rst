==================================

.. note::

  * Darwin Tree of Life Environmental (DToL_ENV) samples' manifest submission can only be done via a
    :abbr:`ToL (Tree of Life)` [#f1]_ profile [#f2]_. Please see:
    :ref:`Steps to Create a Tree of Life Profile <tol-profile-walkthrough>` for guidance.

  * In the **Add Profile** form, the **Profile type** dropdown menu will only display the **Stand-alone** option when
    creating a profile on COPO. :email:`Contact the COPO team <ei.copo@earlham.ac.uk>` inorder to be added to a desired
    profile group and be granted access to choose your desired profile type group.

  * Samples cannot be deleted after they have been submitted.
