How to Download Submitted Sample Manifest
----------------------------------------------

.. hint::

   This is useful if you would like to update sample metadata for a manifest or retrieve the actual manifest that was
   submitted.

   Samples can be updated by resubmitting the manifest with the updated metadata. See :ref:`samples-update` section
   for more information.

.. note::

   At least one sample record (in a manifest) must be submitted before a manifest can be downloaded.

The following steps describe how to download a submitted sample manifest:

#. Navigate to the **Samples** web page.

   See :ref:`How to access Samples web page <accessing-samples-web-page>` section for guidance.

#. On the **Samples** web page, select **only one** sample record from the sample record table displayed.

   Then, click the |download-sample-manifest-button| button to download the manifest.

   .. hint::

      The manifest will be automatically downloaded as a ``.xlsx`` file
