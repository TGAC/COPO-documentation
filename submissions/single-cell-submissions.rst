==============================

:abbr:`COPO (Collaborative OPen Omics)` supports single-cell data submissions, with a focus on the following
technologies:

   * Single-cell Ribonucleic Acid Sequencing (scRNA-Seq)
   * Spatial Transcriptomics Sequencing (ST-Seq)
   * Spatial Transcriptomics Fluorescence In Situ Hybridisation (ST-FISH)

   Single-cell Ribonucleic Acid Sequencing (scRNA-Seq)
   ---------------------------------------------------

   :abbr:`scRNA-Seq (Single-cell Ribonucleic Acid Sequencing)` enables researchers to analyse gene expression at the
   resolution of individual cells. This technique helps uncover cellular heterogeneity, identify novel cell types,
   and understand complex biological processes.

   Spatial Transcriptomics
   ------------------------

   Spatial transcriptomics allows researchers to study gene expression while preserving spatial context within tissues.
   This section will cover different methodologies and applications.

   Spatial Transcriptomics Sequencing (ST-Seq)
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   :abbr:`ST-Seq (Spatial Transcriptomics Sequencing)` provides spatially resolved gene expression data using
   sequencing-based methods. It helps researchers map transcriptomic information to tissue architecture.

   Spatial Transcriptomics Fluorescence In Situ Hybridisation (ST-FISH)
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   :abbr:`ST-FISH (Spatial Transcriptomics Fluorescence In Situ Hybridisation)` leverages fluorescence in situ
   hybridisation techniques to visualise and quantify gene expression at a subcellular resolution. This approach provides
   high spatial accuracy while retaining cellular morphology.
