How to Submit Permits
=====================

.. note::

   * Permits can only be submitted after  :abbr:`ERGA (European Reference Genome Atlas)` [#f1]_ samples have been uploaded in the **Upload Spreadsheet** dialogue.

   * Permits can only be submitted via a :abbr:`ToL (Tree of Life)` [#f2]_ profile [#f3]_. Please see:
     :ref:`Steps to Create a Tree of Life Profile <tol-profile-walkthrough>` for guidance.

.. warning::
    * If you have more than one permit Ô¨Åle to upload, they **must** be uploaded at the
      same time i.e. after you have clicked the |upload-permits-button| button, navigate
      to the directory where the permits are stored and ``CTRL + click`` all of the
      permits so that all the permits are highlighted and uploaded at the same time.
