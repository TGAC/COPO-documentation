  .. hint::

     When submitting sequence annotations (also known as tagged sequences), the sample accession, also known as
     **sraAccession**, follow the format, ``ERSXXXXXXXX``.

  * The **SAMPLE** dropdown menu in the **Add Sequence Annotation** form will display the sraAccession(s) that are
    associated with samples that have been submitted in COPO.

  * The sraAccession can be found in the **sraAccession** column in any data table that is associated with
    the profile and samples. In terms of sequence annotation submission, the sraAccession will be displayed in the
    data table on the **Reads** web page (once reads have been submitted).

Are accessions assigned in sequence annotation submissions after studies are released?

      <br>

   No, accessions are assigned after sequence annotation submissions are done in COPO.

   The study release only makes the submissions public and available for viewing on repositories such as the
   `European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home>`__ and
   `National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov>`__.

   See the :ref:`accessions-dashboard` section for more information.
