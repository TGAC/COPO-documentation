How do I know when data files that have been uploaded to COPO are public at European Nucleotide Archive (ENA)?

See :ref:`Checking ENA File Processing Status <files-ena-file-processing-status>` section for more information.

   .. note::

      The total **maximum** file size that can be uploaded from your local (computer) system is around **2 GB**. If you
      have a file larger than 2 GB or have multiple files whose combined total size exceeds 2 GB, please
      :ref:`submit the file(s) via the terminal <files-submission-via-terminal>`.

   If you cannot upload new files to COPO on the **Files** web page, it is likely that you have reached the maximum
   number of data files that can be uploaded.

   Please delete some files to free up space for new files.
