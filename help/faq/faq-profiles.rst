      <br>

   .. hint::

      Profiles (in COPO) are referred to as projects or studies (in :abbr:`ENA (European Nucleotide Archive)`).

   It is not possible to set the release date for profiles or projects after reads have been submitted.

   By default, once reads are submitted, the project is private and the release date is set to two years from
   the submission date.

   You can, however, make the project public at any time before the release date by following the steps below or refer
   to the :ref:`releasing-profiles` section to make the profile public at any time after the submission.

   If you know the project accession and/or profile title, you can find the corresponding project on the
   `Accessions dashboard <https://copo-project.org/copo/copo_accessions/dashboard>`__. By clicking the hyperlink
   associated with the project accession, you will be navigated to the associated study record on

What happens when a profile is updated in COPO?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. collapse:: Click to view answer

   .. raw:: html

      <br>

   When a profile is successfully updated in COPO, the changes made to the profile will be reflected in the research
   objects such as samples, reads, assemblies or files associated with the profile.

   For example, if a profile is updated to include -

   * a new associated profile type, the new associated profile type will be displayed in the sample records associated
     with the profile.

   * a new :abbr:`ENA (European Nucleotide Archive)` :ref:`locus tag <faq-assemblies-submission-locus-tag-assignment>`,
     the new ENA locus tag will be associate displayed in the reads, sequencing annotations and/ assembles associated
     with the profile.
