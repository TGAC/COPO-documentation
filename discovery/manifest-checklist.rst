Manifest Checklist
=====================

.. hint::

   To view the entire description of a checklist, collapse the description by clicking the
   |collapsible-item-arrow| button below.

The manifest checklist [#f1]_ is a combination of the default European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) [#f2]_ checklist and
additional checklists that are specific to projects. The manifest checklist is used to generate the manifest file
which can be a Microsoft Excel (MS) spreadsheet file, Comma-separated values (CSV) file or a form that is required
to be uploaded to ENA.

An overview of each manifest checklist is given below. It was adapted from ENA `sample checklists <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/checklists>`__
and `annotation checklists <https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/sequence/annotation-checklists.html>`__.
