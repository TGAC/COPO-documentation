Manifest Checklist
=====================

A manifest checklist [#f1]_ is a tabular file (e.g. spreadsheet or CSV) that contains metadata about research objects.

An overview of each checklist is provided below. Some checklists were adapted from
`ENA sample checklists <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/checklists>`__
and `ENA annotation checklists <https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/sequence/annotation-checklists.html>`__.

.. tip::

   The `Manifests web page <https://copo-project.org/manifests/index>`__ provides a list of all available
   manifest templates supported by COPO. See hint

   To view the description of each checklist type on the Manifests web page:

   #. Identify the sample type in the **Category** column on the Manifests web page.
   #. Click the dropdown menu in the **Manifest/Checklist Type** column. A popover will appear with a list of
      sample types.
   #. Hover over the sample type to view its description. The description will appear in a popover.

   Additionally, you can select a sample type from the dropdown menu, then click the **Download** button and
   choose **Blank template** to download a blank manifest. For more detailed guidance on submitting samples,
   refer to the :ref:`samples-submission-genomics` section.
