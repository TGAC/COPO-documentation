Getting started
####################

The project home page is at: https://copo-project.org. You need an ORCID ID to access the application. 

.. hint::

   You can register for an ORCID ID at the `ORCID website <https://orcid.org/signin/>`_. It's free!

.. image:: images/copo-frontpage.jpg

Click on **Try COPO** at the top right corner of the home page (see the image above) to proceed to the login page. This should lead to the ORCID sign in page:

.. image:: images/orcid-login.jpg

Enter your login credentials, or click **Register now** to register a new ORCID account. If the login is successful, a redirection should be made to COPO application.


First time login
------------------

If signing in for the first time a prompt, requesting for an email address, is displayed. Enter an email address to move on. The email address supplied will be associated with the user's account, and used in COPO for tasks (e.g., depositing to remote repositories) involving the user.

A successful login leads to the main work page, which holds all the **work profiles** associated with a user.

COPO Profile
##########################
The first step in getting any meaningful work done in COPO is to define a work profile.

.. note::

   A COPO profile is a collection of *research objects* or components that form part of a research project or study. Any number of profiles may be created, as required, to represent different projects. 
   
Follow these steps to create a new profile:
   

1. Click the **Add new record** icon to present a form 

.. image:: images/create-profile-button.png

.. note::

   Where necessary, a highlight of important controls to watch out for on a page is provided on the screenshot. 

2. Provide details of the new profile and click **Save**

.. hint::

   Form fields in COPO come with a help tip. This functionality can be turned off by toggling the **Help tips** control (see the highlight in the **Add Profile** form screenshot).
   

Profile Components
-------------------

A COPO profile [#profile_name]_ (see :ref:`profile-definition`) comes with a predefined set of component types from which research objects can be created or worked on. COPO currently defines the following component types:

1. :doc:`Samples </sample>` - for creating instances of biological samples
2. :doc:`Datafiles </datafile>`  - for uploading and attributing metadata to data
#. :doc:`Publications </publication>`  - for associating publications resulting from and/or relevant to a project
#. :doc:`People </people>`  - for entering information about collaborators on a project
#. :doc:`Annotations </annotation>`  - for annotating different file types (e.g., PDFs, Spreadsheets) with relevant metadata 

.. image:: images/copo-profile.png

* Component instances defined within a profile will only be visible within that profile [#f1]_. 

* To access a component within a profile, click on the component button displayed within the profile box (see the screenshot above). 

* The number beside each profile button displays the number of items or instances of the component available. 


.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] COPO currently doesn't support sharing of component instances (e.g., samples) across profiles. 
.. [#profile_name] COPO profile and profile will be used interchangeably when the context is clear.
