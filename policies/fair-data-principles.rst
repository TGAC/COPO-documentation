Brokering Data in COPO with FAIR Data Principles
===================================================

:term:`Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR)<FAIR>`  data enables data consumers (people or machines)
to find, aggregate and analyse data that would otherwise be private or invisible, building on the existing web of
linked data.

In COPO, the FAIR principles are applied as follows:

----------
Findable
----------

Using DataTables' search engine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
COPO uses :term:`DataTables` to display tabular data. The data are indexed in the DataTables' *smart* search engine
and the search box is accessible within each table of data; it is located at the top right of the table. The search
engine is updated automatically when metadata is added or updated.

The search box provides the following abilities:
   * Match words out of order
   * Partial word matching
   * Preserved text

See `here <https://datatables.net/reference/api/search()>`__ for more information about searching for data in
DataTables.


Using COPO API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Metadata can also be found via the :ref:`COPO API <copo-api>`.


.. raw:: html

   <hr>

----------
Accessible
----------
The required data can be retrieved freely with unrestricted access or via authentication and authorisation mechanisms,
where necessary.

.. raw:: html

   <hr>

--------------------
Interoperable
--------------------
Data are integrated and available on ENA and NCBI. Data can be exported in csv, json or ro-crate format using
the COPO API.

.. raw:: html

   <hr>

----------
Reusable
----------
Metadata are well-described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes. They are published to public
repositories and can be accessed with the COPO API via a clear and accessible data usage.
