Sharing Profiles
=======================

Sharing profiles or creating a group enable other COPO users to upload or submit research objects such as samples,
experiment, runs, reads, assemblies and sequence annotations  etc. to a profile owned or created by another COPO user.

.. hint::

   * **Profile owner** or **Sharer** refers to the person who created the profile.
   * **Shared user** or **Sharee** refers to the person who has been granted permission by the profile owner to
     upload or submit research objects to the profile created by the profile owner.


In general, the **sharer** shall create a profile, create a group, add the profile to be shared to the created group
then, add the COPO user(s) to the created group.

Thereafter, the shared profile shall appear on the **Work Profiles** web page of the **sharee**.
