Releasing Profiles (Studies)
=============================

.. hint::

   Profiles [#f1]_ (in COPO) are referred to as projects or studies
   (in :abbr:`ENA (European Nucleotide Archive)` [#f2]_ ).

.. note::

   The ability to make a profile public is **only** available after reads have been submitted.

   Thus, the **Release Study** profile option button, |release-profile-button|, should be clicked after reads have been
   submitted.

By default, all profiles [#f1]_ created in COPO are private. This means that the profile is only visible to the user who
created it on COPO and as such, it cannot be accessed on public repositories such as
:abbr:`ENA (European Nucleotide Archive)` [#f2]_.

To make a profile public, please follow the steps below:

#. Click the |vertical-ellipsis-icon| button associated with the desired profile. The option to release the profile
   will be displayed once clicked.

   Then, click the |release-profile-button| button to make the profile public as shown below depending on
   the profile type.

   The profile i.e. project will be automatically be made public and can be viewed publicly in
   :abbr:`ENA (European Nucleotide Archive)`.
