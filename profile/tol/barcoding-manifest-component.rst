====================
Barcoding Manifests
====================

Barcoding manifests are dependent on the type of profile you have created and samples submission as well as the
approval of the samples since biosample accessions are required to submit barcoding manifests.

The following are the types of Tree of Life (ToL) [#f1]_ profiles that can be created:

* Aquatic Symbiosis Genomics (ASG) [#f2]_ samples
* Darwin Tree of Life (DToL) [#f3]_ samples
* Darwin Tree of Life Environmental (DToL_ENV)
* European Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA) [#f4]_

After you have created a desired profile, please proceed to :ref:`submit a barcoding manifest <barcoding-manifest-submissions>`.
