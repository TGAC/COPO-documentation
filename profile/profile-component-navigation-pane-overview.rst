.. _profile-component-navigation-pane-overview:

The component icon navigation pane provides a quick access to other components associated with the same profile. It
appears on the inner right pane of the screen when you are viewing a component’s web page. The icons displayed in the
navigation pane correspond to the components associated with the profile.

If you are unsure what each icon represents, you can perform any of the following:

* Hover over the icon in the component icon navigation pane to see a tooltip with the component's name
* Refer to the :ref:`Component buttons <accessing-image-web-page-via-components-button>` in the section above
* Refer to the :ref:`What are profile components? FAQ <faq-profiles-explain-components>`

.. note::

   * The navigation pane will not display the icon associated with the page that is currently being viewed.

   * If a component has subcomponents, a dropdown menu is shown when at least two items are available. However, if you
     are viewing a subcomponent’s web page and only one item remains, that item is displayed directly in the navigation
     pane.
